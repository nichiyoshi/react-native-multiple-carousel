# react-native-multiple-carousel
Sample react-native app of carousel which allows multiple items at one slide.

Since [**react-native-snap-carousel** may not be supporting  multiple items at one slide](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/102), I made similer function by myself.

Pressing each item is supported.

Jumping items by pressing arrows is also suppoted.
